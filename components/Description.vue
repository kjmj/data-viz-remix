      This project was completed for a data viz course at WPI. Our goal was to
      pick an existing data viz with a dataset, critique it, and improve on the
      viz.

    <p class="subtitle">
      I was lucky enough to also find the dataset associated with it. That
      dataset can be found
      <a

      >. It is important to mention that the dataset kept track of the attention
      different countries received from the NY Times in different years. They
      measured this by counting the number of articles published by the NY Times
      where a particular country is mentioned.

    <p class="subtitle">
      I thought that this was more of a fun metric to keep track of than
      anything else. It's cool to question "Well, why did this country have so
      many mentions during this year?"
